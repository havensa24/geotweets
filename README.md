# Geotweets
Lab 2 of Geog 458 Spring 2022 - Tracking tweets based on key terms and location.
<p>I focused on coronavirus tweets within the past minute as the given time the code was ran, and tweets about any sort of election within the past ten minutes in which the code was ran. I chose coronavirus as slowly, the government seems to be lifting policies on limitations and requirements regarding the virus, and we will see how the public responds to the situation. I then chose "election" as the government and elected officials are always under scrutiny, especially in todays world as southeastern states continue to make policies that limit women and those of the LGBTQ+ community</p>

  The first map shows us how many tweets were sent out across the continental United States that included or discussed the Coronavirus. It shows us that more tweets were sent out across the east coast of the United States, and we can speculate that it seems denser in tweets due to more cities having higher populations, versus the west coast where heavily populated cities are more spread across the coast.</p>

  The second map shows similar in pattern, but rather than focusing on the past minute, it is focused on the past ten minutes and focused on tweets that discuss the election, with "election" being the key term sought out for. We see the west coast is rather quiet in terms of tweets regarding the election, but the east coast shows more data. With what has been going on recently with east coast states such as Florida, and recent policy changes with their elected officials, we can assume that the citizens of Florida are discussing their new mandates and bills based on what elected officals have signed off on.</p>

  <p>Looking at the word map regarding the term coronavirus, "go," "up," and "out" seem to be popular amongst tweets. We can speculate that people are responding to mandates being lifted, now being about to go out more be it sporting events, concerts, dining, etc.</p>

  <p>The words following the term "election" are all over the place. We can use this and see just how divided the country really is, who they like and don't like and how they openly admit that, and their responses to actual election process or results of elections.</p>
